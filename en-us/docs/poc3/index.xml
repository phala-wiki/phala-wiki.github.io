      <description>Go to the account management page of the Phala Testnet: https://poc4.phala.network/polkadotjs/#/accounts
  Click Add Account   Carefully write down the mnemonic seed and check I have saved my mnemonic seed safely, and then click Next. Note: Keep the mnemonic seed safe and secure!   Enter a name and password (and confirm your password.) If you plan to run a Gatekeeper as well as a Miner, we recommend including the word &amp;quot;Controller&amp;quot; for a gatekeeper controller account and the word &amp;quot;Stash&amp;quot; for a miner stash account.</description>

      <description>Create two Phala accounts
 Reference https://hackmd.io/1U7uIEb-RD6bakEKmBlJzg to create a Phala account To help identify the relationship between accounts later, we recommend that you add &amp;quot;Stash&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Controller&amp;quot; to the account names.    Get Test Currency

  Set the binding relationship between stash and controller
Developer Tab → Extrinsics (transaction) → select your Stash account → select phalaModule → choose setStash(controller) -&amp;gt; select your Controller account.</description>

      <description>General Phala Hardware Requirements A system can potentially mine Phala if it meets these general requirements:
It will also need a motherboard and BIOS which support using Intel SGX to run a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
Check Your CPU   Look up your computer&#39;s Processor. On Windows, you can find this in Control Panel/Settings, or right-click on the Start icon and select System. On Ubuntu, click in the upper-right corner, pick Settings, and then pick About.</description>

      <description>Introduction of 1605 Race Privacy Computing Task Who are familiar with Phala Tokenomics know that Phala&#39;s mining rewards are divided into online rewards and computing task rewards. In this 1605 Race V2, on the basis of online rewards, the emphasis is on the introduction of computing task rewards. This article is an introduction to the computing tasks of the Vendetta testnet.
Background summary  The computing tasks in this testnet are generated virtually by the system, and 5 computing tasks are fixed for each Round (600 blocks).</description>

      <description>Start the Phala miner 1sudo phala start  The scripts will run for a long time.The pruntime and phost will start until the full node got the highest block.
 It costs a tiny amount of tPHA as well. Before deploying pHost, please make sure there are a certain amount of tPHA in your Stash account and controller account. Click here to learn how to obtain tPHA.

      <description>Go to Developer -&amp;gt; Extrinsics. Choose your Controller account -&amp;gt; phalaModule -&amp;gt; setPayoutPrefs(payout_comission, payout_target) Fill in commission (from 0 to 100) and choose the account where you want to receive the mining rewards at target.   The commission rate influences your final profits. For any mining reward you get, you always take the commission from it, and then distribute the rest propotionally to the mining stakers. For example, a comission of 100 means all the profits are tranferred to your specified account and a comission of 0 will share all the profits to your mining stakers.</description>

      <description>As designed in Phala Token Economics, each miner is required to stake at least 1620 PHA per core before mining starts. On testnet Vendetta, to better perform a stress test on Phala network and allow more miners to participate, Phala network will automatically stake for miners after they register.
However, to score a higher rank in the Miner Race, you can earn more points by using better hardwares, staking more tPHA, or simply running for a longer period, e.</description>

      <description>Go to Develoepr -&amp;gt; Extrinsics Choose your controller account，click phalaModule -&amp;gt; startMiningIntention() ，and Submit Transaction.  Then you will wait for the next mining period (every 1 hour) to get started.
Mining States Verification  Go to Developer → Chain State Choose phalaModule → workerState, and choose your stash account If there&#39;s a Mining with block height after state, congratulations, your miner is working. If there&#39;s a Miningpending, it means your miner will start mining from the next round (600 blocks later).</description>

      <description>Stop mining  If your miner is not in mining status, feel free to skip this step.
   Refer to this link to stop mining.
  Wait until the end of the current mining period (1 hour per mining period). If you stop the miner too early, you may get slashed.
  Run the following commands to kill the original containers:
1sudo phala stop   Update the Phala miner and clean the local files Run the commands below to remove cached data.</description>

      <description>Miner Community Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask us if you have any questions. You can find us at:

I. Glossary  SGX. Software Guard Extensions. TEE. Trusted Execution Environment. Full-node. A full node is pruned, meaning it discards all information older than 256 blocks, but keeps the extrinsics for all past blocks, and the genesis block. A node that is pruned this way requires much less space than an archive node.</description>
