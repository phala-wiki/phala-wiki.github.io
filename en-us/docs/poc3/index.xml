      <description>Go to the account management page of the Phala Testnet: https://poc4.phala.network/polkadotjs/#/accounts
  Click Add Account   Carefully write down the mnemonic seed and check I have saved my mnemonic seed safely, and then click Next. Note: Keep the mnemonic seed safe and secure!   Enter a name and password (and confirm your password.) If you plan to run a Gatekeeper as well as a Miner, we recommend including the word &amp;quot;Controller&amp;quot; for a gatekeeper controller account and the word &amp;quot;Stash&amp;quot; for a miner stash account.</description>

      <description>⚠️⚠️ Out-of-date Warning ⚠️⚠️
The Phala team has published the new Tokenomics v0.9 in July 2021. We are working on massive refactor and upgrade of the core blockchain and the mining protocol to adopt the latest Tokenomic v0.9 and the Polkadot parachain architecture. When the development is ready, we are going to launch a new testnet (Para1).
The running testnet (poc4-dev) and runtime-bridge are still based on the old mining protocol.</description>

      <description>General Phala Hardware Requirements A system can potentially mine Phala if it meets these general requirements:
It will also need a motherboard and BIOS which support using Intel SGX to run a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
Check Your CPU   Look up your computer&#39;s Processor. On Windows, you can find this in Control Panel/Settings, or right-click on the Start icon and select System. On Ubuntu, click in the upper-right corner, pick Settings, and then pick About.</description>

      <description>Stop mining  If your miner is not in mining status, feel free to skip this step.
   Refer to this link to stop mining.
  Wait until the end of the current mining period (1 hour per mining period). If you stop the miner too early, you may get slashed.
  Run the following commands to kill the original containers:
1sudo phala stop   Update the Phala miner and clean the local files Run the commands below to remove cached data.</description>

      <title>4 Frequently Asked Questions</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/poc3/4-faq/</link>

      <description>Miner Community Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask us if you have any questions. You can find us at:

I. Glossary  SGX. Software Guard Extensions. TEE. Trusted Execution Environment. Full-node. A full node is pruned, meaning it discards all information older than 256 blocks, but keeps the extrinsics for all past blocks, and the genesis block. A node that is pruned this way requires much less space than an archive node.</description>

      <description>Error How to Fix     No genesis block Please upgrade your miner node following these steps.   Failed to decode signature Please kindly check whether your node has finished syncing.   FailedToCallRegisterWorker You may refer to:
1. Go to https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Phala%20PoC-3 and check whether your node has finished sycning;
2. type in sudo docker attach --sig-proxy=false --detach-keys=ctrl-c phala-pruntime to learn whether your pRuntime has been launched</description>
