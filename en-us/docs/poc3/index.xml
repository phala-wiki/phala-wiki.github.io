      <description>Phala Network operates on trusted hardwares, in this case, Intel CPUs which support SGX feature. SGX was first introduced in 2015 with the sixth generation Intel Core microprocessors based on the Skylake microarchitecture. In practice, the support of SGX feature also relies on your motherboard and BIOS configurations. In this section, we will first ensure that necessary hardware requirements are satisfied and all your hardwares are correcly configured.
General Hardware Requirements CPU Requirement You can refer to the following tutorial to ensure that your CPU is SGX-supported.</description>

      <description>System Requirement  This tutorial is based on Ubuntu 18.04. Ubuntu with versions other than 18.04 are not covered in this tutorial, though they and other Linux distributions may also work as well. How to install Ubuntu 18.04 Make sure all your packages are up-to-date:  1  sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt autoremove -y   Install Docker-CE Uninstall the older versions of Docker if they exist</description>

Creating Phala Accounts You need to create two accounts: a stash account and a controller account. You may refer to this tutorial about how to create a single account.
Tip: to better manage your stash accounts and according controller accounts, we recommend to name an account pair with the same prefix. E.g.,

      <description>WARNING: Operations at this step may reset your previous Phala blockchain data and you will need to re-deploy the docker containers. For more detail, refer to our Dockerfile Github repo. You can find the latest Phala Network docker images from the official repo.
PLEASE follow the order of deploying the three docker containers below.
 Deploying Phala full-node A Phala full-node helps maintain the backbone of the network. We suggest you to run a Phala full-node on a device with 50+ GB storage.</description>

      <title>2.2 Set Commission</title>

      <description>Go to Developer -&amp;gt; Extrinsics. Choose your Controller account -&amp;gt; phalaModule -&amp;gt; setPayoutPrefs(payout_comission, payout_target) Fill in commission (from 0 to 100) and choose the account where you want to receive the mining rewards at target.   The commission rate influences your final profits. For any mining reward you get, you always take the commission from it, and then distribute the rest propotionally to the mining stakers. For example, a comission of 100 means all the profits are tranferred to your specified account and a comission of 0 will share all the profits to your mining stakers.</description>

      <title>3.1 Set Miner Stakes</title>

      <description>As designed in Phala Token Economics, each miner is required to stake at least 1620 PHA per core before mining starts. On testnet Vendetta, to better perform a stress test on Phala network and allow more miners to participate, Phala network will automatically stake for miners after they register.
However, to score a higher rank in the Miner Race, you can earn more points by using better hardwares, staking more tPHA, or simply running for a longer period, e.</description>

      <description>Stop Mining  If your miner is not mining, please go to step 2.
   Refer to this link to stop mining.
  Wait until the end of the current mining period (1 hour per mining period). If you stop the miner too early, you may get slashed.
  Run the following commands:
1 2 3 4  docker kill phala-phost docker kill phala-pruntime docker kill phala-node sudo docker image prune -a # type `y` to confirm the deletion     Reset Docker Containers   sudo rm -rf /PATH/TO/YOUR/phala-node-data</description>
