      <description>Introduction To secure the cloud of Workers and the jobs they are assigned, the network will set Confidence Level for each workerâ€™s CPU and will require Staking to enable mining. Each worker can only earn value $V$ if it first stakes several PHA tokens based on its CPU score, after which it can enter the mining system and start TEE Mining.
If a worker misbehaves or fails to respond, it will be punished by slashing the $V$, which strongly incentivizes participants to ensure their workers are running properly and disincentivizes attempts to cheat.</description>
