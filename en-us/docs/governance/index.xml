      <description>Participate in Democracy The public referenda chamber is one of the three bodies of on-chain governance as it&amp;rsquo;s instantiated in Phala and Khala. The other two bodies are the council and the technical committee.
Public referenda can be proposed and voted on by any token holder in the system as long as they provide a bond. After a proposal is made, others can agree with it by seconding it and putting up tokens equal to the original bond.</description>
