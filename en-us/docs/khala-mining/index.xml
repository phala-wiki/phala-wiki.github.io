      <description>General Khala Hardware Requirements A system can potentially mine Phala if it meets these general requirements:
It will also need a motherboard and BIOS which support using Intel SGX to run a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
Check Your CPU   Look up your computer&#39;s Processor. On Windows, you can find this in Control Panel/Settings, or right-click on the Start icon and select System. On Ubuntu, click in the upper-right corner, pick Settings, and then pick About.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites Before you go further, please ensure that your have correct setup your hardware, BIOS and operating system according to the previous section.
Download Phala Scripts The Phala tools are availbale at https://github.com/Phala-Network/solo-mining-scripts/archive/poc5.zip, it can be downloaded with wget by executing the following commands in the terminal:
1sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt autoremove -y 2sudo apt install wget unzip 3cd ~ 4wget https://github.com/Phala-Network/solo-mining-scripts/archive/poc5.zip 5unzip poc5.</description>

      <title>1.3 Check the SGX Capability and Confidence Level</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/1-3-confidential-level-evaluation/</link>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/1-3-confidential-level-evaluation/</guid>
      <description>Double Check the SGX Capability After the installation of your driver, please use the following utility to double check if everything goes well.
  You can run the SGX test by the Phala scripts
1sudo phala sgx-test   Please pay attention to the following checks:
 SGX system software → Able to launch enclaves → Production Mode Flexible launch control → Able to launch production mode enclave isvEnclaveQuoteStatus and advisoryIDs (explained in the next section)  Among them, the first one is a must to run Phala Network pRuntime.</description>

      <title>1.4 Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/1-4-benchmarking/</link>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/1-4-benchmarking/</guid>
      <description>Benchmark Your Worker First, install the needed images with Phala tools:
1sudo phala install If you have installed the images before, you can update them with:
1sudo phala update script Get the performance score with:
1sudo phala score_test [number_of_cores] 2# e.g., sudo phala score_test 4  Tip: We recommend to use all the cores of your CPU.
 The performance test has to be stopped manually with:
1sudo phala stop pruntime-bench After that, you will be asked whether to upload the performance test results.</description>

      <title>2 Solo Mining in Para-1 Testnet</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-solo-mining/</link>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-solo-mining/</guid>
      <description>The following tutorials apply to Para-1 Testnet, which shares the same tokenomics parameters as the future Khala.
Before you start mining in Para-1 Testnet, you need to first get a Khala account and acquire test token from faucet (real PHA is needed in future Khala mining).
Claim Test Token from Telegram Bot  Get to Phala Faucet https://t.me/phalafaucet. You may need to download and install Telegram as prompted. Click &amp;quot;VIEW IN TELEGRAM&amp;quot; to join the group.</description>

      <description>If you have successfully installed the SGX driver and finished the benchmarking, you can skip the following tutorials.  Install SGX Driver You can reinstall the DCAP driver with
1sudo phala install dcap or reinstall the isgx driver with
1sudo phala install isgx Install You can use the following commands to install Phala tools. It will automatically set the number of CPU cores to use, node name, gas fee account mnemonic and pool owner account.</description>

      <title>2.3 Verify Worker Status</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-3-verify-worker-status/</link>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-3-verify-worker-status/</guid>
      <description>Verify Worker Status Read the worker status with:
1sudo phala status An expected worker status is shown as follow, which contains the node name, number of cores, gas account and balance, StakePool account and Worker public key.
 Warning will be sent if your gas account balance is under 2 PHA so you can recharge in time.  </description>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-4-upgrade-worker-node/</guid>
      <description>To upgrade your worker requires it to stop first.
1sudo phala stop The worker node can be updated in a clean way which removes all the saved data
1sudo phala update clean or with the data preserved
1sudo phala update Finally, restart your worker with:
1sudo phala start </description>

      <title>2.5 Use Console to Manage Your Mining</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-5-console/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-5-console/</guid>
      <description>We highly recommend to read staking mechanism before using the Console.
 Console: http://app-test.phala.network/console
Miners and pool owners can use Console to manage Workers and StakePools. Also it provides an overview of the status of all the managed Workers and StakePools.
Console Manual Prerequisites  Create a Khala account as the pool Owner and Worker operator; Get the WorkerPublicKey from Worker and has bound the Worker to the Khala account above.</description>
