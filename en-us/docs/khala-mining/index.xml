      <description>General Khala Hardware Requirements A system can potentially mine Phala if it meets these general requirements:
It will also need a motherboard and BIOS which support using Intel SGX to run a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
Check Your CPU   Look up your computer&amp;rsquo;s Processor. On Windows, you can find this in Control Panel/Settings, or right-click on the Start icon and select System. On Ubuntu, click in the upper-right corner, pick Settings, and then pick About.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites Before you go further, please ensure that your have correct setup your hardware, BIOS and operating system according to the previous section.
Download Phala Scripts The Phala tools are availbale at https://github.com/Phala-Network/solo-mining-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip, it can be downloaded with wget by executing the following commands in the terminal:
1sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt autoremove -y 2sudo apt install wget unzip 3cd ~ 4wget https://github.com/Phala-Network/solo-mining-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip 5unzip main.</description>

      <title>1.3 Check the SGX Capability and Confidence Level</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/1-3-confidential-level-evaluation/</link>

      <description>Double Check the SGX Capability After the installation of your driver, please use the following utility to double check if everything goes well.
  You can run the SGX test by the Phala scripts
1sudo phala sgx-test   Please pay attention to the following checks:
 SGX system software → Able to launch enclaves → Production Mode Flexible launch control → Able to launch production mode enclave isvEnclaveQuoteStatus and advisoryIDs (explained in the next section)  Among them, the first one is a must to run Phala Network pRuntime.</description>

      <title>1.4 Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/1-4-benchmarking/</link>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/1-4-benchmarking/</guid>
      <description>The local benchmark feature is not supported any more. Please run the full mining client, and follow the regular deployment guide. After the worker is registered on the blockchain, you can read the performance score from the blockchain (at Phala App).
Note that benchmarking on the mainnet (Khala) requires to set up real accounts to pay the transaction fee. To test without real coins, you can refer to our Testnet Mining Guide.</description>

      <description>If you have successfully installed the SGX driver and finished the benchmarking, you can skip the following tutorials.  Install You can use the following commands to install Phala tools. It will automatically set the number of CPU cores to use, node name, gas fee account mnemonic and pool owner account.
1sudo phala install By default, all the configurations are set automatically. If you want to manually config the tools, use the following commands and set the parameters.</description>

      <title>2.2 Verify Worker Status</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-2-verify-worker-status/</link>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-2-verify-worker-status/</guid>
      <description>Verify Worker Status Read the worker status with:
1sudo phala status An expected worker status is shown as follow, which contains the node name, number of cores, gas account and balance, StakePool account and Worker public key.
 Warning will be sent if your gas account balance is under 2 PHA so you can recharge in time.  </description>

      <title>2.3 Upgrade Worker Node</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-3-upgrade-worker-node/</link>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-3-upgrade-worker-node/</guid>
      <description>To upgrade your worker requires it to stop first. Note that you may not want to stop mining on the blockchain (via Phala App). This command only stops the software rather than the on-chain state.
1sudo phala stop The worker node can be updated in place:
1sudo phala update Finally, restart your worker with:
1sudo phala start Update and wipe data This command will update the docker images AND removes all the saved data.</description>

      <title>2.4 Use Console to Manage Your Mining</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-4-console/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/2-4-console/</guid>
      <description>We highly recommend to read staking mechanism before using the Console.
 The Console
Miners and pool owners can use Console to manage Workers and StakePools. Also it provides an overview of the status of all the managed Workers and StakePools.
Console Manual Prerequisites  Create a Khala account as the pool Owner and Worker operator; Get the WorkerPublicKey from Worker and has bound the Worker to the Khala account above.</description>

      <description>To be updated.
 I. Increase Confidence Level Currently, Tier 1, 2, 3 are treated in the same way. No operation is needed if you are at these tiers. However, if you are at Tier 4 or 5, you can try the following tips. You can also join the Discord or Telegram miner group to discuss.
Got CONFIGURATION_NEEDED and CONFIGURATION_AND_SW_HARDENING_NEEDED  The EPID signature of the ISV enclave QUOTE has been verified correctly, but the additional configuration of the SGX platform may be needed (for further details see Advisory IDs).</description>

      <description>The problem Some of our friends that running our nodes may found their nodes are struggling to connect to any peer which causes nodes to be dropped from the whole wonderful network. In this KB you may find why and what to do.
Stateful firewall As IPv4 is exhausting, also as there are some security concerns or some design considerations. There’s a lot of stateful firewalls between you and peers that run NAT, policy-based filter, or both.</description>
