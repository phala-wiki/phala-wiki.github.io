      <title>Run a Gatekeeper</title>
      <link>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/poc2/run-a-gatekeeper/</link>

      <guid>https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/poc2/run-a-gatekeeper/</guid>
      <description>This guide will instruct you how to set up a validator node on the Phala Network.
Preliminaries Running a Gatekeeper on a live network is a lot of responsibility! You will be accountable for not only your own stake, but also the stake of your current nominators. If you make a mistake and get slashed, your money and your reputation will be at risk. However, running a Gatekeeper can also be very rewarding, knowing that you contribute to the security of a decentralized network while growing your stash.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re building dapps or products on a Phala Network, you probably want the ability to run a node-as-a-back-end. After all, it&#39;s always better to rely on your own infrastructure than on a third-party-hosted one in this brave new decentralized world.
This guide will show you how to connect to Phala Network PoC-2. First, let&#39;s clarify the term full node.
Types of Nodes A blockchain&#39;s growth comes from a genesis block, extrinsics, and events.</description>

      <description>How to check whether your device is SGX-supported:
 Whether your hardware CPU is SGX-supported Refer to the SGX Hardware List Take the SGX Test  BIOS Settings  Google how to enter your BIOS Settings. Enter BIOS after reboot. Go to Security -&amp;gt; Secure Boot, set it to Disabled. Go to Security -&amp;gt; SGX, set it to Enabled (or any other option that is similar as the description varies according to different manufacturers.</description>

How to intsall Make all your packages up-to-date: type sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt autoremove -y in the terminal.   How to open your Terminal: right click on your desktop → Open in Terminal
 Install SGX driver If you have already installed the SGX driver, you can verify by:
 Type ls /dev | grep sgx in the terminal If there&#39;s any output, your SGX driver is ready.</description>

Creating Phala Accounts You may refer to this tutorial.
Tip: to better manage your stash accounts and according controller accounts, we suggested you naming an account paired with the same prefix. E.g.,
 Emily Stash / Emily Controller
 Obtaining tPHA  Please be aware that you will need to burn ERC20 PHA to obtain tPHA on testnet Vendetta.</description>

      <description>ALERT: Operations at this step may reset your previous Phala blockchain data and you will need to re-deploy the mirror files. For more detail, refer to: https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-docker#usage
PLEASE DO NOT change the order when deploying the three docker containers below.
 Deploying Phala full-node A Phala full-node helps maintains the backbone of the network. We suggest you to run a Phala full-node on a device with 50+ GB storage.</description>

      <description>Go to Developer -&amp;gt; Extrinsics. Choose your Controller account -&amp;gt; phalaModule -&amp;gt; setPayoutPrefs(payout_comission, payout_target) Fill in commission (from 0 to 100) and choose the account where you want to receive the mining rewards at target.   The commission rate influences your final return. For any mining reward you get, you always take the commission from it, and then distribute the rests propotionally to the mining stakers. Of course you get all if it&#39;s all your own stake.</description>

      <description>As designed in Phala Token Economics, each miner is required to stake at least 1620 PHA per core before mining starts. On testnet Vendetta, to better perform a stress test on Phala network and allow more miners to participate, Phala network will automatically stake for miners after they register.
However, to score a higher rank in the Miner Race, you can earn more points by using better hardwares, staking more tPHA, or simply running for a longer period, e.</description>

   Refer to this link to stop mining.
  Wait until the end of the current mining period (1 hour per mining period). If you stop the miner too early, you may get slashed.
  Run the following commands:
1 2 3 4  docker kill phala-phost docker kill phala-pruntime docker kill phala-node sudo docker image prune -a # type `y` to confirm the deletion     Reset Docker Containers   sudo rm -rf /PATH/TO/YOUR/phala-node-data</description>
